<h2>Short and Sweet</h2>
	<em>Self-taught programmer</em>. Began my journey with <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/lc101">LauchCode</a>
	in their LC101 program, spanning 9 months. This gave me practice with programming fundamentals(Python, problem solving),
	basics of web applications (HTML/CSS, MVC, Git), and Object-Oriented Programming with Java (Data Structures and 
	Algorithms). Udemy has helped me take my Java knowledge even deeper with the 
	<a href="https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/">Complete Java Masterclass</a>. I bang my head
	against DS/A problems everyday to keep growing at <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hackerranker</a> and 
	<a href="http://www.programmr.com/">Programmr</a>.
