	<h1>Kate Boston</h1>
	Back-end Software Engineer in Java</br>

	<center><h2>_Summary of Qualifications_</h2></center>

Self-taught back-end software engineer blazing my own way into tech. I contribute 5+ years of work experience and skills that 
traditional CS candidates simply can’t, like a knack for finding win-win solutions, a passion to understand the whole before 
working on a piece, and the drive to build legible code {simple, then improve}. My interests lie in developer experience and 
user-driven products. I am excited to move into software development engineering role to continue growing my skillset as I am 
a true believer that skills can be taught, but genuine enthusiasm cannot.</br>
