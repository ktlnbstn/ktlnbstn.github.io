	<center><h2>_Summary of Qualifications_</h2></center>

Collect, Preserve, Tend, Share.</br>
My background in Anthropology and Museum Collections inform my approach to information management. 
I see information as a community resource, something to be protected and shared with all. </br>

I contribute 5+ years of increasingly responsible information management work and 2 years of project 
coordination experience, a knack for finding win-win solutions, and a passion to understand the whole before 
working on a piece. I accomplish this by continuously learning new technologies, reading deeper into documentation 
and learning resources, and asking pointed questions.</br>
