- Overview<br/>
			<blockquote>
This repository showcases a complete, multi-user blog webapp. Users are allowed to view all available blog posts and select posts by author, 
though they are required to login/register an account to submit a new post. The app allows a user to submit a post which redircts to the main post page. 
User passwords are encrypted in the database for added security. Users can view their own blog pages and may delete their posts.

It demonstrates my ability to mainpulate Flask, SQLAlchemy, and user verification and security processes. The files are broken out into an MVC-style format.
