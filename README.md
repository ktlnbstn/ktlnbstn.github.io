## Welcome to ktlnbstn's GitHub Page

I am learning Python, HTML, and CSS surrently. I will also move on to Java.
GitHub will serve as a central location for my projects and as a simple method to reach out to me. 

More information, including my resume, can be found on LinkedIn at [ktlnbstn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ktlnbstn/).
