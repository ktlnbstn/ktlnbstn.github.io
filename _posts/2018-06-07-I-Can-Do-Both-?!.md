Personal projects and OOP languages, oh my!
Study this! Look at that! Everything is so shiny and fun looking. This is a sort of repeat post from IG, 
but ovbiously, I will have the space to expound upon my thoughts here. Less repetition in the future, I pinky promise.

I will talk about my personal priorities as I endure this wild ride of unemployment-with-hopes-of-landing-an-SDE-position.
Let me name my top three. Then I will go into detail about each, then talk about ways to balance it all.

1. Personal Project
2. OOP Language Deep Dive
3. Data Structures and Algorithims

<em>Personal Project</em>
This is huge. As a self-taught programmer, I don't have college courses or an internship to point to if/when recruiters and 
interviewers come a callin'. I have to prove my skills through <strong>multiple<s/trong> (at least 3 projects), 
<strong>valuable</strong> (3-4 features per project), <strong>relevant</strong> (in demand technologies and tools) web 
applications that are bug-free and hosted somewhere so my projects are easily accessible.

<em>OOP Language Deep Dive</em>
This one I have recieved mixed feedback about. Yes, I will need to interview and be competent on the job, but (apparently) No,
I don't need to know things like the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-jdk-jre-jvm/">differences between JDK, 
JRE and JVM</a> right out of the gate. Hmmm. I'm prone to over preperation, so I would like to know as much about a language 
as I can before interviews and meeting potential coworkers, so I still strive to cram as much of this type of learning in as
I can.

<em>Data Structures and Algorithims</em>
Only for the interview. Then everyone forgets it, because when you're a developer, you have the time to research these things if
needed. Siiiiigh. So the memorization and practice begins.
