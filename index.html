	<center><h2>Hello! I'm Kate!</h2></center>

	<p>I have a passion for digital innovation and want to help shape the future. My background in 
	Anthropology informs my desire to create user experiences that add value beyond the bottom line. 
	I plan to contribute to facilitating proper information architecture in artificial intelligence.</p></br>

	<p>I contribute 8+ years of descriptive and subject cataloging expertise, 3 years translating 
	customer needs and coordinating projects, a knack for finding win-win solutions, and experience 
	with the software development lifecycle. I accomplish my goals by continuously learning new 
	technologies, reading deeper into documentation and learning resources, and asking pointed questions. </p></br>

	<p>Skills: information management; migrations and remediations; procedures; taxonomy and metadata; 
	information architecture; standards. </p></br>

	<p>This site will serve as my project site, collecting my code and links to live projects.</p>
