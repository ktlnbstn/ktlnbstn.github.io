	<center><h2>Hello! I'm Kate!</h2></center>

	<p>I have a passion for digital innovation and want to help shape the future. I am interested in 
	information architecture in artificial intelligence. I contribute 8+ years of descriptive and subject 
	cataloging expertise, 3 years translating customer needs and coordinating projects, a knack for 
	finding win-win solutions, and experience with the software development lifecycle. I accomplish my 
	goals by continuously learning new technologies, reading deeper into documentation and learning resources, 
	and asking pointed questions. </p></br>

	<p>This site will serve as my project site, collecting my code and links to live projects.</p>
